//! Enumeration used with pango types

/// The PangoGravity type represents the orientation of glyphs in a segment of text. This is useful when rendering vertical text
/// layouts. In those situations, the layout is rotated using a non-identity PangoMatrix, and then glyph orientation is controlled
/// using PangoGravity. Not every value in this enumeration makes sense for every usage of PangoGravity; for example, PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO
/// only can be passed to pango_context_set_base_gravity() and can only be returned by pango_context_get_base_gravity().
